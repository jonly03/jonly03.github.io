              Nelly was my instructor for a full stack development boot camp. I entered his class with minimal coding
              knowledge, and on the many occasions that I felt overwhelmed, discouraged and ready to quit, Nelly was by
              my side giving me encouragement and making sure I understood the material. Nelly is the most all-in,
              dedicated teacher I've ever had- he consistently went above and beyond for me. He was my tutor, my mentor
              and is now a lifelong friend. His passion for coding and life itself is so sincere, he truly is a bright
              light in this world. Thank you for everything Nelly!

              Nelly is a fantastic teacher. He has the ability and patience to teach anyone. His enthusiasm is
              contagious and his drive is inspiring. At the time I met Nelly, I knew nothing about Web Development.
              After a very short time, he was able to give me the tools to create a foundation on which I was able to
              grow and build as a developer. Nelly once told me it was his calling to teach those around him. I believe
              he has found his path. Thank you Nelly for the energy you bring to this world.

              Those are the words I have seen Nelly live by everyday as a teacher. He did not just do the job of
              teaching us coding but helped us find it within ourselves on days when most of us almost gave up.
              Not only a great teacher but a gem of a human being who lives for others. His passion to help others makes
              him one of the best teachers I have come across in my life. He has the skill to teach complex subjects in
              a way that not only makes it easy to understand but also gives you the confidence of tackling it on your
              own. I can not recommend Nelly enough and believe that whoever gets him as a teacher should consider
              themselves as the lucky ones.
              Way to go Nelly!

              I had the pleasure of being one of Nelly’s students and the Northwestern University coding boot camp.
              Right from the go he always brought his smile, his patience, and knowledge to everything he did. Nelly has
              a dynamic personality and engaging teaching style that truly helped me develop as a developer. When I
              started with Nelly, I quite literally knew only what I had taught myself, which was near to nothing. Over
              the course of the class, post graduation, the job search grind, and ultimately through accepting a job

              student understood the difficult material was remarkable, often meeting students in off time for private
              tutoring. Nelly approaches everything in life with passion and drive. I can't recommend him highly enough.
              Easily the most committed teacher I have ever had as well as a simply phenomenal human.

              Nelly is an accomplished mentor, developer, and teacher. He has been instrumental in my progression as a
              developer and the same can be said for many others. He's the kind of person you want as an instructor or a
              team mate. This is because Nelly has overcame more adversity than a large portion of students he will
              encounter. He has cultivated a well of patience that extends to students as well as colleagues. Although
              patient he is one of the hardest working people that I have encountered in any field. This is seen in his
              work, his teaching, and how he approaches life in general. I really can not say enough great things about
              Nelly. If you have the opportunity to work with Nelly in any capacity I would highly recommend it.

              Nelly has passion, heart, and a way of teaching that "doesn't make you feel [dumb]" (quoting from another
              student of his). He puts in every effort to ensure his students learn and understand both the front-end
              and
              back-end portions of full-stack development.
              <br />
              <br />
              On several occasions, he met with me and my group (for many hours) for our projects to teach us how to use
              MySQL, Handlebars.js, React, rendering the proper code onto the page, and a refresh of how Git branches
              worked. He worked with me in my own project on using MongoDB, Mongoose, discussed plans and diagrams on
              how
              to approach React and Mongo on said project, and met with me several times on Zoom to code with me,
              remaining patient the entire time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Not only can he teach, he develops his own apps, as well - along with coding an app featuring a card game
              from his home country, he also coded and promoted (ie, drove to multiple cities to test it) an app for
              pick-up basketball (which made me slightly more interested in the sport)!
              <br />
              <br />
              It was an honor to be Nelly's student - I'm glad he took the leap and flew to California to teach the
              inaugural class of UC Davis Extension's Coding Boot Camp!

              this intensive 6 month coding program.
              <br />
              <br />
              He walked in and assumed his position a true teacher, someone who goes beyond using words to explain
              concepts. He lights up when he's helping others. Nelly is a leader and his energy electrifies the air
              around him. Anyone who walks into the same room as him will know that he is making an impact beyond
              measure.
              <br />
              <br />
              He brings more to the table than just knowledge. Nelly brings fiery determination to pull this world up by
              its bootstraps. He unrelentingly believes in his students and their futures. And I know this because he
              never failed to see us in our true potential.

              I was a student of Nelly's in July of 2018. He was a wonderful instructor and helped me realize my goal of
              becoming a full time web developer. The career he helped me launch has led me to become a tutor for the
              same organization he taught for. In one year I learned how to speak four different code languages, manage
              full-stack applications, build/deploy and run the continued cyber security and data viz for site
              performance. I've created an app that can deliver streaming video in less than 1 second to first render.
              None of this would have been possible if it weren't for Nelly's unique focus on problem solving and

              Nelly did not just teach me how to code, he opened an entire new world. I brought absolutely no coding
              experience to the table and was very unsure of how far I could go in this career path before I took his
              course. But not only did I learn React, Node, Express, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, RESTful
              APIs, MongoDB/Mongoose, SQL/Sequelize, MVC, Heroku Deployment, and Git-Github, but MOST IMPORTANTLY he
              taught me how to think and problem solve. But how did he do it?
              <br />
              <br />
              Nelly led extra class sessions, reviews, and even one on one help to anyone who needed it. I was a
              successful student because I had a diligent instructor who not only would not let me fail, but not even
              imagine that anything less than success was a possibility.
              <br />
              <br />
              On graduation day I knew that Nelly had fulfilled his promise to my class that anything we wanted to
              create, we could, no limitations! Not only did I learn, but I became so confident in my abilities and
              inspired at how coding can change people's lives, that I became a teaching assistant and one on one tutor
              for the course Nelly taught me. I love web development, I love clean code, I love problem-solving, all of
              which stem from a charismatic and compassionate instructor like Nelly. There is not a person who can walk
              away without being enriched after learning with him.

              When I think back to my time as a student in Nelly's Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp class, I

              inspiring me to love software development and teach me the fundamentals I needed to know. Nelly is
              extremely technically skilled, but his true gift is his ability to teach. I have come to find that this is
              a rare skill in software development and I appreciate Nelly taking the to invest in each and every one of

              Nelly was my tutor, and let's be honest, my lifesaver, when I decided to go back to school to learn coding
              when I was almost 50 years old! I was so fortunate to have found him because not only is he gifted at
              helping others learn to code, he is also completely inspiring. He loves to code and he loves to help
              others learn to code. It is impossible not to catch his enthusiasm for the craft.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have to share one of many memorable stories of Nelly's commitment to learning. I had a project due the
              next day and he was helping me through some struggles I was having with my part. At some point we learned
              that my partner on the project had dropped the ball and I was determined to finish the entire project
              before the presentation. Nelly stayed on the video call with me ALL NIGHT! We finished at 5am. That shows
              a lot of commitment - but here is the really interesting part. The entire time we were working, he never
              just gave me the answers, he always made me learn. Even at 3am when I was said, oh come on, just tell me
              the answer!!! He would patiently suggest a different viewpoint or approach, and I would learn something
              new! I will be forever grateful for his wisdom and his encouragement. If you are on the fence about asking
              for help - talk to Nelly right away! You will be glad you did.

              I was Nelly's student from July 2018-October 2018 at the Northwestern Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. At the
              time, I was a freelance blog writer and lyric transcriber and delivered for Postmates. I was desperately
              looking for a career change. I had managed websites via WordPress before, but had no experience with
              coding outside of very basic HTML and CSS. When first making this transition into the world of web
              developing it can be very overwhelming. There are so many acronyms, libraries, frameworks, languages out
              there that imposter syndrome is nearly impossible to avoid. Nelly not only taught us how to code, but he
              taught us patience and perseverance. I saw firsthand Nelly get excited over error messages or scripts not
              working as expected. This helped me change my mindset from being intimidated and frustrated when things
              don't work as expected to being excited at opportunities to solve problems through debugging code.
              <br />
              <br />
              I originally went to college to become a High School English Teacher. I quickly decided that I did not
              have a passion for teaching, but this same passion that I lacked I can clearly see in Nelly. He takes his
              time to get to know his students individually and what motivates them, and how they best learn. He also
              approaches the classroom more like getting together with a friend who is showing you something. I really
              appreciated everything Nelly did for us and would take another class with him 10/10 times if given the
              opportunity!

              I walked into Northwestern University's Coding Boot Camp in 2018 with a certain mindset of what kind of
              experience I should be preparing myself for, what I aimed to get out of it, and what I expected the next
              12 weeks of my life to approximate. Nelly was lucky enough to be the point person for me on this
              experience, and he was going to shape what I was able to learn in this accelerated time schedule, with
              very little experience into the development world that I was preparing for. Nelly is a great teacher, he
              fundamentally understands what he is trying to help you learn (and knows how to search for the answer when
              he doesn't know), and he has the problem solving skills to break apart an issue into discrete finite
              problems that can be solved one at a time. Those qualities are to be expected of a great teacher, but what
              made Nelly stand out from anyone else were the reasons he chose to stop and spend hours at a time helping
              you solve a single problem. Nelly was able to convince each and every one of us, that regardless of your
              experience, mindset, and attitude - everyone was teachable, and everyone could learn. The technical
              details come and go, and search engines go a long way - but teachers who leave behind moments are the ones
              worth trusting your time and effort to. Nelly is one of them (thank you, Nelly!).

              Nelly is an amazing Instructor. I was his student for 3 months
              full time camp. I learned a lot from him. He's very knowledgeable.
              He had well thought deep answers to all of my questions and my
              classmates'. He is very patient and thorough when it comes to
              explaining complex material in a simplified way. He has a strong
              ability to keep his students engaged and interested in the
              material he teaches. It was very obvious he has a strong deep
              knowledge of the technologies he taught us and of the software
              development field in general. I worked closely with him during my
              projects and class work and could experience how talented he is.
              He has a very amiable presence and would be a great, valuable
              addition to any place/position he's in. I'm grateful to him for
              all the knowledge he gave me and the hours of help he offered me

              cared about us and never left any of us no matter what was the

              Google Doodles history starts on 1998/8/30 when Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, designed
              the first Google Doodle to let Google users at the time that Larry and Sergey were at the Burning Man
              Festival, just in case the servers crashed :). Ever since, Google has been designing Google Doodles to
              celebrate different people and events through out history.
              <br /><br />
              Having always been intrigued by them, naturally, I built a web app that
              can go back into history and tell you which Google Doodle was used on which date.
