              I was Nelly's student from July 2018-October 2018 at the
              Northwestern Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. At the time, I was a
              freelance blog writer and lyric transcriber and delivered for
              Postmates.
              <br />
              <br />
              I was desperately looking for a career change. I had managed
              websites via WordPress before, but had no experience with coding
              outside of very basic HTML and CSS. When first making this
              transition into the world of web developing it can be very
              overwhelming. There are so many acronyms, libraries, frameworks,
              languages out there that imposter syndrome is nearly impossible to
              avoid. Nelly not only taught us how to code, but he taught us
              patience and perseverance. I saw firsthand Nelly get excited over
              error messages or scripts not working as expected. This helped me
              change my mindset from being intimidated and frustrated when
              things don't work as expected to being excited at opportunities to
              solve problems through debugging code.
              <br />
              <br />
              I originally went to college to become a High School English
              Teacher. I quickly decided that I did not have a passion for
              teaching, but this same passion that I lacked I can clearly see in
              Nelly. He takes his time to get to know his students individually
              and what motivates them, and how they best learn. He also
              approaches the classroom more like getting together with a friend
              who is showing you something. I really appreciated everything
              Nelly did for us and would take another class with him 10/10 times
              if given the opportunity!

              Those are the words I have seen Nelly live by everyday as a
              teacher. He did not just do the job of teaching us coding but
              helped us find it within ourselves on days when most of us almost
              gave up. Not only a great teacher but a gem of a human being who
              lives for others. His passion to help others makes him one of the
              best teachers I have come across in my life. He has the skill to
              teach complex subjects in a way that not only makes it easy to
              understand but also gives you the confidence of tackling it on
              your own. I can not recommend Nelly enough and believe that
              whoever gets him as a teacher should consider themselves as the
              lucky ones. Way to go Nelly!

              I had the absolute PRIVILEGE of learning Web Development from
              Nelly, his teaching style is not only progressive and
              forward-thinking, it encourages ingenuity from his students;
              fosters true interpersonal growth that best serves each individual
              he mentors by adapting his teaching style to meet the needs of
              those around him. Nelly's breathe of knowledge is impressive to
              say the very least, but it's his passion for this industry and for
              this students that sets him apart from anyone I have ever been
              blessed enough to meet! Nelly has hands down changed my hunger for
              growth, learning, and deep desire to pay it forward and pass off
              knowledge. He is the epitome of a true leader and teacher! Nelly

              Nelly was my instructor for a full stack development boot camp. I
              entered his class with minimal coding knowledge, and on the many

              Nelly was by my side giving me encouragement and making sure I
              understood the material. Nelly is the most all-in, dedicated
              teacher I've ever had- he consistently went above and beyond for

              Nelly is a fantastic teacher. He has the ability and patience to
              teach anyone. His enthusiasm is contagious and his drive is
              inspiring. At the time I met Nelly, I knew nothing about Web
              Development. After a very short time, he was able to give me the
              tools to create a foundation on which I was able to grow and build
              as a developer. Nelly once told me it was his calling to teach
              those around him. I believe he has found his path. Thank you Nelly
              for the energy you bring to this world.

              With no experience in JS, HTML, or CSS, Nelly taught me what I
              needed to know to be a full-stack developer in 3 weeks. I could
              not recommend him enough, he taught more than just curriculum but
              really made us run through the process of coding and debugging
              while he was guiding us and having us think through the process. I
              only wish I had more than 3 weeks with him because there is no
              telling how much more I could have learned.

              I had the pleasure of being one of Nelly’s students and the
              Northwestern University coding boot camp. Right from the go he
              always brought his smile, his patience, and knowledge to
              everything he did. Nelly has a dynamic personality and engaging
              teaching style that truly helped me develop as a developer. When I
              started with Nelly, I quite literally knew only what I had taught

              post graduation, the job search grind, and ultimately through
              accepting a job offer, Nelly was there to support, motivate, and
              inspire! Thankful to call him a friend and mentor. Cheers, Nelly!

              more adversity than a large portion of students he will encounter.
              He has cultivated a well of patience that extends to students as
              well as colleagues. Although patient he is one of the hardest
              working people that I have encountered in any field. This is seen
              in his work, his teaching, and how he approaches life in general.
              I really can not say enough great things about Nelly. If you have
              the opportunity to work with Nelly in any capacity I would highly
              recommend it.

              If you walk into a classroom and Nelly is your instructor, be
              aware that you're luckier than any person who has won the lottery!
              <br />
              <br />
              Nelly has passion, heart, and a way of teaching that "doesn't make
              you feel [dumb]" (quoting from another student of his). He puts in
              every effort to ensure his students learn and understand both the
              front-end and back-end portions of full-stack development.
              <br />
              <br />
              On several occasions, he met with me and my group (for many hours)
              for our projects to teach us how to use MySQL, Handlebars.js,
              React, rendering the proper code onto the page, and a refresh of
              how Git branches worked. He worked with me in my own project on
              using MongoDB, Mongoose, discussed plans and diagrams on how to
              approach React and Mongo on said project, and met with me several
              times on Zoom to code with me, remaining patient the entire time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Not only can he teach, he develops his own apps, as well - along
              with coding an app featuring a card game from his home country, he
              also coded and promoted (ie, drove to multiple cities to test it)
              an app for pick-up basketball (which made me slightly more
              interested in the sport)!
              <br />
              <br />
              It was an honor to be Nelly's student - I'm glad he took the leap
              and flew to California to teach the inaugural class of UC Davis
              Extension's Coding Boot Camp!
              <br />

              It had been a while (like a couple of months) since I had picked
              up anything HTML/CSS/JS oriented to create a CRUD app and to be
              fair, I was a bit rusty. Nelly was able to not only draw that
              information out of me, but was able to even teach me something new
              (thank you breakpoints!).
              <br />
              <br />
              The thing about Nelly, and his teaching styles, is that he truly
              wants you to get it. He doesn't want you to just be able to do
              what needs to be done, but to have finesse with it. To have a
              truly full and fleshed out understanding of the mechanics that are
              being used.
              <br />
              <br />
              I've only had a few mentors (thank you Resilient Coders) who were
              able to uphold that level of instruction; a careful, well rounded
              and in-depth instruction that increases my foundation of learning
              and gives me new skills to jump from.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you need a teacher for full-stack building apps, and maybe even
              some no-code; Nelly is the one for you.

              When it comes to tech training, Nelly is by far the best
              instructor I've encountered. Nelly's initial act was to establish
              a personal rapport with each and every one of the students. During
              our time together, we became quite close, and Nelly spoke to us as
              if he were one of us. Nelly's dedication to providing the best
              possible education was clear to anybody who met him. In addition
              to teaching me HTML, CSS, JS and REACT's foundations, Nelly also
              simplified a number of complex areas that I had previously found
              difficult. He was able to break down difficult concepts and
              explain them in novel ways that made it easier for us to
              understand them. To me, the most enjoyable component of Nelly's
              teaching technique comes from his energetic and positive demeanor.
              When he's in the room, there's never a dull moment. There's nobody
              I know more qualified to teach programming than Nelly.

              Nelly taught our HTML/CSS/JS portion of the TLG SDE apprentice
              cohort. He is patient, kind, deeply knowledgeable, and a wonderful
              instructor. He is equally at home covering basics in detail until
              everyone is on board, as well as diving deep into the bowels of
              something he is learning along with a student to figure out how to
              implement a new library. I can't recommend him highly enough.

              I was one of Nelly's students. Nelly is an unrelenting powerhouse.
              I knew this from my first day in his class, when he recognized the
              tremendous empowerment my class was festering and birthing by
              signing up for this intensive 6 month coding program.
              <br />
              <br />
              He walked in and assumed his position a true teacher, someone who
              goes beyond using words to explain concepts. He lights up when
              he's helping others. Nelly is a leader and his energy electrifies
              the air around him. Anyone who walks into the same room as him
              will know that he is making an impact beyond measure.
              <br />
              <br />
              He brings more to the table than just knowledge. Nelly brings
              fiery determination to pull this world up by its bootstraps. He
              unrelentingly believes in his students and their futures. And I
              know this because he never failed to see us in our true potential.

              I was a student of Nelly's in July of 2018. He was a wonderful
              instructor and helped me realize my goal of becoming a full time
              web developer. The career he helped me launch has led me to become
              a tutor for the same organization he taught for. In one year I
              learned how to speak four different code languages, manage
              full-stack applications, build/deploy and run the continued cyber
              security and data viz for site performance. I've created an app
              that can deliver streaming video in less than 1 second to first
              render. None of this would have been possible if it weren't for
              Nelly's unique focus on problem solving and procedure. I've been
              very lucky to have such a positive influence in my career!

              Nelly did not just teach me how to code, he opened an entire new
              world. I brought absolutely no coding experience to the table and
              was very unsure of how far I could go in this career path before I
              took his course. But not only did I learn React, Node, Express,
              HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, RESTful APIs,
              MongoDB/Mongoose, SQL/Sequelize, MVC, Heroku Deployment, and
              Git-Github, but MOST IMPORTANTLY he taught me how to think and
              problem solve. But how did he do it?
              <br />
              <br />
              Nelly led extra class sessions, reviews, and even one on one help
              to anyone who needed it. I was a successful student because I had
              a diligent instructor who not only would not let me fail, but not
              even imagine that anything less than success was a possibility.
              <br />
              <br />
              On graduation day I knew that Nelly had fulfilled his promise to
              my class that anything we wanted to create, we could, no
              limitations! Not only did I learn, but I became so confident in my
              abilities and inspired at how coding can change people's lives,
              that I became a teaching assistant and one on one tutor for the
              course Nelly taught me. I love web development, I love clean code,
              I love problem-solving, all of which stem from a charismatic and
              compassionate instructor like Nelly. There is not a person who can
              walk away without being enriched after learning with him.

              code and I am happy to say that I am now a software engineer for a
              Fortune 500 company. Nelly played a huge part in inspiring me to
              love software development and teach me the fundamentals I needed
              to know. Nelly is extremely technically skilled, but his true gift
              is his ability to teach. I have come to find that this is a rare
              skill in software development and I appreciate Nelly taking the to
              invest in each and every one of his students. It was truly a
              pleasure being in Nelly's class and if you have a similar goal of

              you reach that goal.

              Nelly was my tutor, and let's be honest, my lifesaver, when I
              decided to go back to school to learn coding when I was almost 50
              years old! I was so fortunate to have found him because not only
              is he gifted at helping others learn to code, he is also
              completely inspiring. He loves to code and he loves to help others
              learn to code. It is impossible not to catch his enthusiasm for
              the craft.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have to share one of many memorable stories of Nelly's
              commitment to learning. I had a project due the next day and he
              was helping me through some struggles I was having with my part.
              At some point we learned that my partner on the project had
              dropped the ball and I was determined to finish the entire project
              before the presentation. Nelly stayed on the video call with me
              ALL NIGHT! We finished at 5am. That shows a lot of commitment -
              but here is the really interesting part. The entire time we were
              working, he never just gave me the answers, he always made me
              learn. Even at 3am when I was said, oh come on, just tell me the
              answer!!! He would patiently suggest a different viewpoint or
              approach, and I would learn something new! I will be forever
              grateful for his wisdom and his encouragement. If you are on the
              fence about asking for help - talk to Nelly right away! You will
              be glad you did.

              I was fortunate enough to have Nelly as my instructor at the UC
              Davis coding bootcamp in Sacramento, California. His passion and
              dedication to teaching and his students is impressive to say the
              least. Nelly is an amazing teacher able to tailor his teaching
              strategies to each individual, and is very patient with a "you can
              do it" attitude. His optimism is catagious and makes you feel like
              you can succeed no matter what. He always went above and beyond
              what was required, including being available for questions or
              tutoring at any time day or night. I highly recommend Nelly to
              anyone wanting to learn coding to add to their skill set or as a
              career.

              Nelly is a creative instructor with a knack for getting students
              to listen. He is such a good combination of a professional
              knowledgable developer and a humourous interesting teacher. His
              lectures have always been very informative and interesting and
              have never been boring. He is a great instructor and I've learned
              a lot! Nelly is probably one of the best if not maybe the best
              instructor I've ever had.

              during my July 2018 Full Stack Web Development course at
              Northwestern University. Nelly has a true passion and talent for
              teaching. His optimism, attentiveness and innate curiosity make

              I walked into Northwestern University's Coding Boot Camp in 2018
              with a certain mindset of what kind of experience I should be
              preparing myself for, what I aimed to get out of it, and what I
              expected the next 12 weeks of my life to approximate. Nelly was
              lucky enough to be the point person for me on this experience, and
              he was going to shape what I was able to learn in this accelerated
              time schedule, with very little experience into the development
              world that I was preparing for. Nelly is a great teacher, he
              fundamentally understands what he is trying to help you learn (and
              knows how to search for the answer when he doesn't know), and he
              has the problem solving skills to break apart an issue into
              discrete finite problems that can be solved one at a time. Those
              qualities are to be expected of a great teacher, but what made
              Nelly stand out from anyone else were the reasons he chose to stop
              and spend hours at a time helping you solve a single problem.
              Nelly was able to convince each and every one of us, that
              regardless of your experience, mindset, and attitude - everyone
              was teachable, and everyone could learn. The technical details
              come and go, and search engines go a long way - but teachers who
              leave behind moments are the ones worth trusting your time and
              effort to. Nelly is one of them (thank you, Nelly!).

              He has a very amiable presence and would be a great, valuable
              addition to any place/position he's in. I'm grateful to him for

              Nelly really exemplifies the qualities of servant leadership where
              everything he does is meant to enable the people that work in his
              teams. I don't really feel like I'm working for Nelly but that we
              are working on a team that aligns with his vision. Nelly
              constantly practices a growth mindset and enables instructors and
              students alike through being open to new ideas and processes.

              I met Nelly a little less than a year ago. He is so energized
              about life. He seeks accomplishments, not only for himself but for
              those around him. He sincerely cares about other people and spends
              his energy building successes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Considering that he is from a country where computers are
              something others have, he has built a technology (and education)
              career that surpasses the vast majority of the people I know and
              work with that grew up around technology. His success comes from
              the work he's put into learning and sharing with others. He is an
              living example of "you can do anything you put your mind to". He
              has encouraged me to tackle a new career teaching software
              development at the college level. My new career comes from Nelly's
              encouragement and passion for helping others be the best they can
              be.

              I had the pleasure of working in a support role for Nelly during
              his time at Northwestern Coding boot camp. Nelly had an amazing
              ability to engage and energize students. His passion and
              enthusiasm for code, teaching, and life was absolutely contagious.
              Nelly played a big part in inspiring me to pursue my own career in

              I taught under Nelly in a Coding Bootcamp for 6 months, and I
              would say Nelly has the rare talent that glues the entire

              leave any student behind. He was a great teacher and true leader,

              Nelly not only has strong technical abilities but is more
              importantly a motivator. He is a very strong and effective
              communicator. This gives him the ability to benefit teams and
              large groups. I believe that Nelly is best placed in leadership
              roles where his skills as a motivator will be most effective.
              Nelly is very ready to share stories of his past experiences and
              provides details and insights that many others are too shy to
              share. This level of transparency and authenticity really helps
              show individuals that they truly do have something to bring to the
              table and urges them to do so. Nelly’s versatility makes him a
              great addition to a variety of teams. I am excited to see what he
              does next!
